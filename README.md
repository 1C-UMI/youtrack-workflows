To use a ready workflow file in your YouTrack, please:
*    Download a `workflow zip file`
*    Import the workflow to your project

If you are project administrator import workflow on Administration > Projects > project > Workflow tab.
If you have system administrator permissions, import workflow on Administration > Workflow page and attach it to one or multiple projects.

You can also try any of the custom workflows listed below in our [YouTrack InCloud test instance](http://workflows.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/). All registered users get project admin permissions.
