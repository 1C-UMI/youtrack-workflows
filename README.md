==================

Welcome to YouTrack Workflow Repository!

To use a ready workflow file in your YouTrack, please:
    Download a workflow zip file.
    If you are a project administrator, then import the workflow to your project in Administration > Projects > project > Workflow tab.
    If you have system administrator permissions, then import the workflow to your YouTrack in Administration -> Workflow page and attach it to one or multiple projects.

You can also try any of the custom workflows listed below in our YouTrack InCloud test instance. All registered users get project admin permissions.
